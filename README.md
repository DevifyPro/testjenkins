This Jenkinsfile checks out the source code for the PHP application using the GitHub repository URL and branch specified in the job configuration. 
It then launches a Docker container with Bitnamiâ€™s PHP-FPM image and creates a temporary workspace to perform all operations. 
Finally, it runs the listed commands to download and install Composer, download dependencies and run phpUnit tests in the container. 
The build is considered successful if all tests pass.
